* \section intro Introduction
*
* LASS is a Library for Additive Sound Synthesis.  LASS is based on
* theoretical contributions by Hans G. Kaper, Senior Mathematician at
* Argonne National Laboratory, and Sever Tipei, Professor of Music at
* University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and manager of the Computer
* Music Project of the UIUC Experimental Music Studios.  LASS reflects many
* of the lessons learned with two earlier additive synthesis systems,
* DIASS_M4C and DISCO, developed by the same authors.
* 
* LASS can generate an arbitrary number of sounds, each of them containing
* an arbitrary number of partials.  It allows the user detailed control over
* each partial. LASS is unique in the way it allows users to specify the
* loudness of a sound, a nonlinear function of amplitude.  The amplitude of
* a sound is adjusted using the ISO equal-loudness curves and a number of
* critical bands.
* 
* The design of LASS was guided by three principles: expandability, ease of
* use, and efficiency.  The architecture of LASS is very modular.  No doubt,
* new features will need to be added, and future users/developers must be
* able to easily expand the system.  The library is user friendly.  The
* interfaces to classes were made as clear as possible and kept consistent
* across objects.  Extensive use of references instead of pointers helps
* insure good memory management.  Finally, LASS must also be efficient
* because sound synthesis is computationally intensive.
* 
* Unlike its predecessors, LASS is not a MusicN-type program:  it uses
* function evaluations instead of table look-ups and does not require a
* "score."  Instead, it produces an XML file, which is used only as a record
* and not as input.
* 
* The general framework of LASS and many of its features were written by
* Braden Kowitz.  Over a period of two and one-half years, many students,
* participants in the "Advanced Computer Music" seminar at UIUC, have also
* contributed to the project.
