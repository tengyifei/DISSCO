To generate the documentation, either install doxygen on the system so that it
is available on the path, OR copy the binary file 'doxygen' into this directory.
The generator first looks on the PATH, then it tries the current directory. This
way you do not need to have administrator priviledges in order to get the docs.

After doxygen is somewhere the script will find, simply type:
./view-latest-docs.sh

To generate and view (in Firefox) the latest documentation.

If you do not need to regenerate the documentation and simply want to view it:
./view-docs.sh
