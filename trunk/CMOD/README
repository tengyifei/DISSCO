CMOD, a module for composition, written in C++, is a "floating hierarchy"
that creates certain objects which could be themselves collections of
objects.  It consists of classes dealing with various aspects of a 
composition and a number of utilities.  CMOD takes also advantage of 
LASS features such as the Envelope class.  When used in conjunction with 
LASS, the output consists of computer-generated sounds.  Other options
are contemplated but not developed yet: scores for acoustic instruments
or voices, visual objects, or a combination of all three options.

CMOD reads data describing each type of object from text files that are
created by the user according to the needs of each particular project.

CMOD is still being tested in its present form.
