In PATTER:
There is no way of remembering a pattern once it has been created. It is
created anew everytime Pattern is called.  A record of it (of patty) has 
to remain available until the entire pattern has been assigned.  Now, 
the pattern is created from a file for each new sound.

GetNextValue - nextIndex is set to 0 everytime Pattern is called for.  This
way it always picks up the first element of the pattern.  "Patty" is not i
remembered.

Range: now takes only integers.  Needs to take also envelopes and, in that i
case, the value of "checkPoint" has to be available to the Patter class.
